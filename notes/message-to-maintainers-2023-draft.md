# Draft message to lesson maintainers, 2023

## Background
There was an action in the [January 2023 CAC meeting](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors/blob/main/minutes/Jan-2023-minutes.md)
to check in with all lesson maintainers.

## Message

Dear [x, y, z],
CC Cody,

I am writing to you on behalf of the Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee. 
Cody and I are contacting all lesson maintainers to check in and see what help you may be interested in. 
I would be most grateful if I could please have five minutes of your time to respond to my questions below?

1. Do we have the list of active maintainers correct for your lesson? I believe it is [x, y z]. 
2. The list of maintainers on the lesson repo page does not agree with the official record on the LC website. [Detail]. 
Would you kindly please update this page on your lesson?
3. We can help you to find and train additional maintainers through our channels including email and Slack. Would you be interested in help here?
4. We can help to organise a bug BBQ or code sprint to address any of your lesson's [n] open issues. Would this interest you?
5. [Alpha or conceptual lessons only] Your lesson is currently at [alpha/conceptual] level. 
Would you like help moving it up one of the LC lesson paths? (Details below.)

You may have seen the Carpentries Incubator [link]. It is a great way for original and legacy lessons to gain attention and boost their development. 
When lessons in the Incubator have gone through the [appropriate steps for adoption](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors/blob/main/policy/lesson-adoption.md), they can be considered for introducing into official Library Carpentry lesson programme. 
We can also move current alpha LC lessons into the Incubator. 

Finally, we are looking at improving the Library Carpentry lesson pathways, https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors/issues/4 for the discussion. If you have any thoughts on where your lesson would fit here, please share them with us.

If you could please respond by [date], we could then take your responses to the next LC Curriculum Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the next steps.

Best regards,

Phil
