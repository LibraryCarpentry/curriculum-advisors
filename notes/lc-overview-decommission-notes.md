## LC-Overview Lesson Removal Announcement

To the Library Carpentry Community,

Quick update: We're removing the LC-Overview lesson from the core curriculum by March 29, 2024. The Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee (LC-CAC) decided this lesson no longer serves its curricular function.

- [Instructors](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors)

Thanks for adapting with us.

Best,
Lisa McAulay and Tim Dennis
LC-CAC
