# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2025-04-03 UTC 15:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Toby Hodges, Jesica Formoso (guest), Irene Vazano (guest), and Nathaniel Porter (guest) 

## Agenda

### A Path to Open, Inclusive, and Collaborative Science for Librarians lesson
Jesica and Irene joined the CAC to discuss their new lesson on [Collaborative Science for Librarians](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-collaborative-science/), which hasn't been taught yet. Jesica and Irene would like to stay on as maintainers and would be open to others joining them. Next steps for advancing the lesson towards beta were discussed.

#### Action items: 
- The CAC will work to promote the lesson to LC communities so that more instructors can pilot the lesson and provide feedback.

### Open Qualitative Research
Nathaniel joined to discuss the new [Open Qualitative Research lesson](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-open-qualitative-research/). The base lesson focuses on Taguette, but there is a [fork that is still in progress using Qualcoder](https://ndporter.github.io/open-qualitative-research-qualcoder/). The Taguette lesson has been taught twice, and the Qualcoder lesson once, with Nathaniel co-teaching. At this stage, Nathaniel is leaning more towards developing the Qualcoder lesson. The CAC plans to seek pilots outside of US university settings, and with instructors not affiliated with the lesson.

#### Action items: 
- The CAC will work to promote the lesson to LC communities so that more instructors can pilot the lesson and provide feedback.

### LC ten year anniversary
Library Carpentry was first taught in November 2015 at the Centre for Information Science, City University London. The CAC discussed plans to organize a community call to celebrate the anniversary with some early founders and active early members of LC. 

#### Action items: 
- Toby will email James Baker to see if he's interested and available to take part, after which we will reach out to others to participate.
