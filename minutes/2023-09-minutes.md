# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2023-09-21 UTC 16:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Mark Laufersweiler, Phil Reed, Toby Hodges; Guests: Elizabeth (Lisa) McAulay, 

### Agenda

#### Meeting times

LC-CAC will adjust meeting times beginning in 2024 to alternate between UTC 15:00 and UTC 23:00 meetings, to accommodate a new member joining from Australia. 

*Action items*:
Cody will schedule the 2024 meetings before the Nov 16, 2023 meeting, and reach out to the new member to confirm the plan.

#### LC Overview lesson disposition (Lisa, Cody, and Toby)
LC-CAC discussed and approved of the proposal to retire the current LC Overview lesson and remove it from the LC core lessons. See [GitHub issue for full proposal](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-overview/issues/49#issuecomment-1683957172). Given the strong LC-focus it wouldn't make sense to move the retired repo to the Incubator, so once details are confirmed, the repo will be made into a read-only archive in LC's GitHub. 

*Action items*:

- Lisa will work with Tim to outline a plan for migrating any Overview lessons that have ongoing value. They will report back to LC-CAC in November.
- They will also decide on a deadline to make the changes and update the current lesson with a callout to advertise the planned changes.
-  LC-CAC will announce more detailed plans to the community via the #libraries and #instructors Slack channels and topicbox lists, once full details are confirmed.
-  LC-CAC will confirm recommended beginning lessons for LC workshops once the Overview lesson is gone.

#### Guiding Learners on configuring multi-factor authentication for their GitHub accounts (Toby)

Toby shared the Carpentries plans (informed by outreach to maintainers) to update Git lessons with information about the newly required GitHub multifactor authentication. LC-CAC approved the recommended changes.

*Action items*:
Toby will open a PR with the changes in the LC-Git lesson and Lisa (as one of the lesson maintainers) will see that it moves forward in a timely manner.

#### LC Intro to Python (Cody)
Cody met with Nathaniel Porter and Owen Stephens who provided helpful feedback on planned updates. The lesson will move to JupyterLab, and use an open dataset of library circulation data, with a narrative focused on workflows for analyzing annual circulation.

*Action items*:
If you know people who may be interested in joining as co-maintainers, please let Cody know.

#### Intro to Computational Thinking (Tim)
Tim worked with a graduate student to migrate the Intro to Computational Thinking lesson to the new Carpentries workbench - see [repo](https://github.com/ucla-data-science-center/intro-computational-thinking) and [public lesson site](https://ucla-data-science-center.github.io/intro-computational-thinking/). It should be moved to the Incubator and reviewed in the Carpentries Lab review before LC-CAC moves it to the LC curriculum.

*Action items*:

- Tim will start the process to move the lesson to the Incubator by opening an [issue in the Proposals repo](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/issues/new?assignees=tobyhodges&labels=proposal&projects=&template=lesson_proposal.yml&title=%5BProposal%5D%3A+). 
- Once the Incubator lesson is ready for review in Carpentries Lab, an issue should be [opened here.](https://github.com/carpentries-lab/reviews/issues/new?assignees=tobyhodges&labels=review&projects=&template=review_submission.yml&title=%5BReview%5D%3A+)

#### Intro to AI for GLAM lesson
There are a number of outstanding issues waiting to be addressed in the AI lesson. LC-CAC discussed opportunities to encourage more maintainer buy-in and activity on continued development.

*Action items*:
Phil will reach out to maintainers and offer community assistance to work through issues. 

#### Items to review at future meeting
- UCLA-IMLS Open Science Lessons update (Tim)
- FAIR Data and Software Curriculum (Alexis G)
- LC Overview lesson retirement, Next steps
