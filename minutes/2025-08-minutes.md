# Library Carpentry Governance Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2025-08-05 UTC 15:00:00

Attending: Tim Dennis, Cody Hennesy, Toby Hodges, Levi Dolan (guest), and Abigail Sparling (guest).
## Agenda

### Recruitment for LCGC
The Carpentries are [seeking new governors](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/07/calling-for-new-lesson-program-governors/) for Library and Software Carpentry.

### ORCID for Librarians lesson (Levi Dolan)
We discussed the [new ORCID lesson](https://firbolg.github.io/LC_ORCID/) created via the UCLA Open Science for Librarian project. It has been taught as alpha once, and feedback was integrated. Since the current lead maintainer (Levi) is unsure of time to commit to advancing the lesson in the coming year, we agreed that a good next step would be to move the lesson to the Incubator. Levi will fill out the Incubator lesson proposal form to initiate that process.

### LC MarcEdit (Abigail Sparling)
Discussed next steps to begin a formal Carpentries Lab review of the MarcEdit lesson, after which the lesson could be designated as a stable lesson. Members of LCGC will serve in editorial roles, and we will seek two reviewers from the Carpentries community who have topic expertise. Given current workloads, the goal is to line up participants with the plan to review the lesson around Oct - Dec 2025. Abigail and a co-maintainer will share potential reviewer names with LCGC. Cody will also update the LC Lessons pages to reflect the current lesson beta status.
