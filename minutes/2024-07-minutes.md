# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2024-07-18 UTC 15:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Toby Hodges, and Jennifer Stubbs (guest).
 
## Agenda

#### LC Pathways
Jennifer Stubbs shared proposals for improving support for novice learners in LC. The CAC agreed that a Novice/Foundations pathway of lessons such as Intro to Computational Thinking, Tidy Data, Shell, and Regex should be added as a path through the LC curriculum. We should also keep an eye on the Incubator [Foundational Computer Skills lesson](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/foundational-computer-skills) - if it moves to alpha/beta, it would be a great fit here. There are also opportunities to create more engaging and accessible exercises in existing lessons to emphasize fundamentals such as files and directories. 

Discussed a draft of potential path topics and a reconfiguration of [the Lessons page](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) to highlight pathways. CAC agreed that the Lessons page should remain as a flat view of the full curriculum, while a new page should be created to highlight pathways. Work will continue to make sure to align pathways work with audience needs (e.g., I-school student topic interests) and existing work on training material metadata (e.g., [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/TrainingMaterial/1.0-RELEASE)). Once CAC aligns on paths, we need to reach out to core team as there will be infrastructure and process implications to work out. 

*Action items*:  

- Cody will mockup potential designs for a new Pathways page that would help users mix + match lessons and more easily scan possible paths. This will also improve display of R and Python options within paths, add a Foundations path, and adding R & Python to the Software Dev path.
- Cody will make a PR to update the current lessons page to remove extraneous content, and refactor lesson tables to add a column for lesson length and remove the column for instructor notes. 


#### Intro to Computational Thinking
Discussed adding more appropriate exercises - instead of mathematics example in episode 2, for example, create a good library/info example. (One idea: breakdown steps to build an index for a book.) Overall the lesson could use new maintainers who are available to update content across the full lesson to better suit LC audiences.  

*Action item*: Tim will add a call for new maintainers to the blog post announcing the lesson. Jennifer is considering coming on as a co-maintainer, given the relevance to a foundational computing LC path.

#### UCLA IMLS open science lessons
The 2024 cohort of open science lessons have been selected and will begin working on collaborative lesson development in late July.
