# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2022-07-29 UTC 01:00:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Phil Reed, Toby Hodges, Annajiat Alim Rasel, Mark Laufersweiler


### Agenda

#### Policy on adding lessons to the LC curriculum

Tim started to draft of a [lesson adoption process](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors/blob/main/policy/lesson-adoption.md) that points to the Carpentries Labs as the formal editorial and review mechanism for adding new lessons to the LC curriculum. A general workflow for LC-CAC should be: 

1. Assess whether or not a particular lesson makes sense for a Library Carpentry audience. 
2.  If it does, meet with maintainers to go over the lesson and advise them on any changes necessary to help them move it from alpha to beta.
3. Add the lesson to the LC website "extended curriculum" section once it's in beta and reach out to find instructors to teach the lesson and provide feedback. 
4. Once the lesson has been taught and maintainers have responded to instructor feedback, the maintainers should submit the lesson for formal review in Carpentries Labs.
5. Members of LC-CAC can serve an editorial role in the Labs process, going through the initial Labs checklist (est time, ~ 1 hour) and to help to find suitable reviewers for the lesson. 

LC-CAC still needs to work out with the forthcoming LPGC about how best to coordinate decision-making and process for adding and removing lessons to the LC curriculum. 

*Action items*:
Cody will update the lesson adoption process doc to reflect the workflow above.

#### Lesson program governance committee (LPGC)
Toby briefly introduced the new [lesson program governance policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#lesson-program-governance-policy) and we discussed the transition of the LC Advisory Group into an LPGC. 

#### Existing lesson submissions

The team discussed how to move along the [Introduction to Data Curation for Reproducibility](https://curating4reproducibility.org/cure-carpentry-01-intro/) and [Intro to AI for GLAM](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-librarians-archivists/) lessons.

*Action items*:

* Tim will review the curation lesson and email the maintainers to invite them to an upcoming CAC meeting for feedback on moving from alpha to beta.
* Tim will add the Intro to AI for GLAM lesson to the LC website, under Extended Curriculum and reach out on Library Carpentry channels (Slack, email...) to promote instructors to teach the lesson and provide feedback to the maintainers. 

#### LC lesson retirement
Discussion of how to retire the XML and FAIR data lessons. 

*Action items*:
Phil will create a new "Retired lessons" heading for the LC Lessons page and move the XML and Top 10 FAIR Data & Software Things lessons there. He will email Carpentries team to start process of moving the XML and Top Ten FAIR repos out of LC and into the Incubator, adding a note that the lessons have been retired.

#### 2023 LC-CAC schedule
The group agreed to meet every other month in 2023, to allow for better momentum on LC-CAC initiatives.

*Action items*:
Cody will find times and send Google Calendar updates for 2023 meetings beginning Jan 2023.
