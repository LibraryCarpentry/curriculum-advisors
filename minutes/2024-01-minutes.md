# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2024-01-18 UTC 23:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Mary Filsell, Mike Trizna (guest), Leigh Phan (guest)

## Agenda

#### Intro to AI for GLAM code sprint

Mike and Leigh from the Intro to AI for GLAM lesson joined the meeting to discuss plans for the Jan 31, 2024 code sprint, co-hosted by the LC-CAC. Sprint notes will be maintained on [this etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/ai-glam-sprint). The goal of the sprint is to move the lesson closer to Stable and to ultimately move it into the LC core curriculum.

*Action items*: Following the sprint, LC-CAC will work with Toby to communicate to the community about the AI for GLAM lesson development path and the impact of the code sprint. 

#### Core curriculum restructuring 
Work continues to decommission the LC Overview lesson. Lisa McAulay has documented most of the remaining work on the [lesson issues page](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-overview/issues). 

*Action items*: Cody will schedule a meeting with Tim and Mary to make final decisions about what to do with remaining episodes from LC Overview lesson.

#### Changes to Core Team (Phil)
Phil reported back about an open meeting with Toby, re: Carpentries staffing changes affecting CACs. Core team will no longer coordinate CAC recruitment and onboarding or provide a CAC liaison. They will communicate to maintainers when a CAC becomes inactive (so LC-CAC should make sure to contact Core Team if that ever becomes the case). Core team can help us promote a call for new members if we choose to recruit on our own. 

#### Intro to Computational Thinking
UCLA DataSquad students worked with Tim to update the Computational Thinking lesson to the new workbench and [submitted it to the Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/issues/182). This lesson was designed and written by Belinda Weaver.  

*Action items*: Tim will move the lesson directly to the LC repo as an alpha lesson. LC-CAC should create issues for the checklist, and communicate to the community, especially to find opportunities to pilot the lesson and get instructor feedback.

#### Intro to Curation for Reproducibility (Tim)
A (final) email was sent to maintainers to ask about progress and to offer help transitioning to the Workbench. 

#### Workbench help
UCLA has two students who are well versed in the workbench and may be available to help LC-related lessons transition. Email Tim at tdennis@library.ucla.edu to inquire.

#### Items for future meetings

- LC-CAC recruitment (March meeting)
- Updating LC website with new lessons
- Lesson adoption visit from DMP101 <http://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/dmp101/>
