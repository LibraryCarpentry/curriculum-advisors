# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2023-05-18 UTC 15:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Phil Reed, Annajiat Alim Rasel; Guest: Elizabeth (Lisa) McAulay

### Agenda

#### LC-Git lesson

Discussed possibilities for major changes to the [LC Git lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/) with Lisa McAulay, one of the current maintainers. LC-CAC liked Lisa and Phil R's idea to update the lesson to focus more on GitHub literacies (e.g., searching on GitHub, starting an issue). One plan for episode order would be to start with new content that focuses on GitHub literacies, then add an episode about editing content on GitHub, then the GitHub Pages episodes, and finally introduce the Git command line at the end of the lesson (with the idea that it could be skipped depending on audience needs).

LC-CAC also agreed that we should encourage Nathaniel Porter to move his [Git GUI lesson](https://github.com/ndporter/lc-git-gui) into the incubator. LC could link to his lesson from an episode of our official Git lesson for learners who may want more information about working with GitHub Desktop.

*Action items*:
- Tim will reach out to Chris Erdmann since there may be an early plan for a Git lesson that took a similiar approach to what we're planning.
- Phil will reach out to Nathaniel about moving the Git GUI lesson into the Incubator.
- Lisa will begin initial planning for restructuring the LC Git lesson and return to a future LC-CAC meeting.


#### LC Overview lesson
Discussion with Lisa about clarifying paths through the LC curriculum in the [Overview lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-overview/). We decided to move the discrete episodes (Jargon Busting, Keyboard Shortcuts, A Computational Approach, File Naming and Formatting, One Up One Down, and Further Reading) out of the Overview lesson repository, and to make the entire focus of the lesson about providing lesson overviews and pathways for the full LC curriculum, in the style of Data Carpentry. We should find a better place for the discrete episodes to live in LC, however, since many of those episodes are valuable.

*Action items*:
Lisa will come up with an initial plan of action to present at the next LC-CAC meeting, in July 2023.

#### Updated LC lesson audit spreadsheet to note migration to workbench

Phil has been updating the [lesson audit spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/192j2nRgusL1S75OZxDcivFtQZ1EedRj6ZARA7u3N80A/edit#gid=0) to note which lessons have migrated to the workbench, updating maintainer lists, and noting maintainers who didn't reply to the Carpentries survey. LC-CAC still plans to reach out to maintainers to offer assistance.


#### MarcEdit lesson moving to alpha 
LC-CAC approves moving the LC MarcEdit lesson from conceptual to alpha, and the lesson has been migrated to the workbench - see related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/librarycarpentry.github.io/pull/172#issuecomment-1531661517). Suggestions from LC-CAC to maintainers to continue moving the lesson towards Beta include to add instructor notes, collect and respond to feedback when the lesson is taught, and generally to follow the [Lesson Release Checklist](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/lesson_release.html).

*Action items*:
Phil will make change on LC website for MarcEdit to move to alpha lesson and contact maintainers.

#### CAC survey
Toby (via notes) shared the survey to confirm which LC-CAC members would like to continue to serve.

#### Update on LC Lesson Program Governance Committee and relationship with CAC 
Toby wasn't able to attend but updated LC-CAC via the Etherpad: 
- "the LCGC was established with five members: Eka Grguric (Chair), Lisa McAulay (Secretary), Belinda Weaver, Yared Abera, Mary Filsell. 
- Briefly: the idea is that the Governance Committee (LCGC) has a  similar role to that of the Advisory Group that came before it, with responsibility for overall strategy and advocacy for the lesson program. Curriculum matters are still the responsibility of the CAC and (unless you hear otherwise from the LCGC) this group has authority over matters relating to curriculum development, adoption of new lessons, etc. 
- During the Governance Committee onboarding, I encouraged the GC Chairs to invite their respective CAC chairs to meetings whenever relevant, and I hope to see a healthy dialogue taking place between the two groups. As far as I am aware, the group has not yet scheduled its first meeting."

#### UCLA taught Intro to AI for GLAM 
UCLA taught the [Intro to AI for GLAM lesson](https://ucla-data-science-center.github.io/2023-05-08-UCLA/). which generated great discussion and interaction. The instructors are currently formulating feedback for authors.

#### Retiring LC Python lesson
Tabled for a future meeting.
