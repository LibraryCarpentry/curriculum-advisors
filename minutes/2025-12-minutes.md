## Agenda & decisions

### Administrative & governance
- Announced Library Carpentry 10‑year post and welcome to new LCGC members. Agreed to switch to new governance documents/repositories for 2026 and update the LC Governance page.
- Scheduling: agreed to stagger two‑year terms so roughly half roll off end of 2027. 
- Cody will set up monthly LCGC meetings for 2026–2027.
- Toby will ask Technology team to update Governance page; check SWC term limits during Dec SWC governance meeting.
- LCGC members can act as reviewers/editors/wranglers for lessons moving from beta → stable via the Carpentries Lab.


### Chair / Secretary roles
- Roles and responsibilities reviewed. Cody and Tim will serve as Co‑Chairs Jan–Mar 2026; secretary role (scheduling, timekeeping, minutes) to be confirmed later.
- Decision process: async feedback acceptable; “seeing no objection, motion carries” approach can be used for non‑urgent decisions.


### Lesson maintenance & migration strategy

RDM / CaSDaR grant

- Discussed CaSDaR funding (deadline 22 Jan) to reuse materials from the cancelled NIH/MITRE project for UK-focused curriculum development and pilot workshops. PI must be at a UK academic institution.
- Nicky & Toby will pursue groundwork with University of York and report back.
- LCGC members will help adapt prior proposal materials if Nicky and Toby communicate possibility to move forward.

Wikidata lesson (lc-wikidata)

- Decision: change lesson status to pre‑alpha so that it can stay listed as conceptual on LC lesson page, and publish a blog to solicit pilots and feedback.
- Cody will change lc-wikidata to pre‑alpha.
- Nicky will draft blog and consult York/Wikimedia contacts.

Repository transfers & maintainer access

- GLAM Machine Learning: need transfer instructions and maintainer check‑in.
- Qualitative research (Taguette / QualCoder): maintainer privileges did not transfer; QualCoder is beta and ready to move into the LC organization.
- Toby will investigate repo transfer process and request Technology team to restore/grant maintainer privileges and unblock migrations.
- Nathaniel will proceed with planned community call and pilots; coordinate transfer timeline with Toby/Technology team.

### IMLS UCLA Open Science pilots
- Tim will post call for volunteers to pilot new lessons.

## Future meetings
- Follow up on Wikidata with Rabea Müller; potential move to Beta (see issue thread).
- Invite Katie Frey and Jennifer Bartlett to discuss the SciX lesson.
