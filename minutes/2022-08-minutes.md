# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2022-07-29 UTC 01:00:00

Attending: Erin Becker, Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Liz Stokes


### Agenda

#### Proposal to adopt Carpentries Lab for adding new lessons to the LC Curriculum

Tim discussed the possibility of LC-CAC using peer review via [the Carpentries Lab](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/#the-carpentries-lab) as part of our formal process for adding new lessons to the LC curriculum. The group discussed possibilities, and outlined a general workflow that might begin with lesson maintainers discussing inclusion with LC-CAC, the creation of a rubric or process for LC-CAC to use to decide whether the lesson topic is suitable for LC, and then using Carpentries Lab for peer review. 

*Action items*:

* Tim will draw up a more formal proposal and share it via the [LC-CAC GitHub](https://github.com/libraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors) for feedback. 

#### Retiring the LC FAIR data and software and XML lessons

Liz and Phil Reed had shared the possibility of retiring these lessons, based on their work with maintainers and their current levels of inactivity. LC-CAC thought the best course of action would be to retire both lessons by using the GitHub archive feature and updating the LC website to remove the lessons. Archived GitHub lessons should still be accessible. Other longer term preservation ideas (such as pushing to Zenodo) were discussed, but those might be implemented in the future on a case-by-case basis (e.g., if authors need to preserve more stable and citable records of their work). 

*Action items*:

* Liz will archive the LC FAIR lesson on GitHub.
* Phil will archive the XML lesson.
* Once the lessons are archived, Cody (or anyone else on the LC-CAC) can do a pull request to remove the lessons from the public website 

#### LC lesson audit update

The group discussed initial steps at auditing LC lessons. Phil created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/192j2nRgusL1S75OZxDcivFtQZ1EedRj6ZARA7u3N80A/edit#gid=0) documenting lessons in terms of recent activity, number of outstanding issues, and active maintainers. Next steps will include sorting the lessons into categories to identify appropriate follow-up messages to relevant lesson maintainers.  Likely lesson categories for follow up on are:

* Active lessons with minor or major issues: Offer maintainers support to arrange for code sprints to address outstanding issues and PRs. Includes asking maintainers to update maintainer lists on GitHub repo readme files (many are out of date). For lessons with substantial issues, confirm that maintainers are actively engaged.
* Lessons to discuss for possible retirement: Get feedback from community on lessons that seem out of date to see if folks are teaching them. LC-CAC would also want to solidify retirement process/guidelines before moving forward.
*  Lessons with no action required. 

Because we don't currently have a way to track when specific lessons are taught, LC-CAC also discussed the possibility of creating lesson paths such as DC uses (e.g., Astronomy curriculum, Ecology curriculum) for LC. This would give us a hook to track when specific lesson paths are taught via GitHub. It could also simplify the choices for local hosts and provide helpful subsets of LC lessons such as Data Skills for Collection Management, Curating for Reproducibility, or Open Science for Librarians. 

*Action items*:

* All are welcome to annotate the [lesson spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/192j2nRgusL1S75OZxDcivFtQZ1EedRj6ZARA7u3N80A/edit#gid=0) with useful context and Cody will begin to sort the sheet into categories before our next meeting, as noted above. 
* Liz posted an [issue](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors/issues/4) on the LC-CAC GitHub with more information on possible lesson paths and to seek community feedback. 

#### Other updates

* LC-CAC doesn't need to worry about LC lessons with broken anchor/heading links. The Carpentries development team are addressing this.
* A reminder about the CarpentryCon session on LC curriculum which will happen on Thursday, August 4, 2022 at 16:00:00 UTC [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/cc2022-library-carpentry-curriculum). Open to all and especially LC maintainers other CAC members. Cody will share with CAC listserv (curriculum-advisors-all@lists.carpentries.org).
* UCLA got a [grant from IMLS](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-252335-ols-22) to work on Open Science Lessons for Librarians. Tim is working to support the grant, and Cody will serve on the review committee as a rep from LC-CAC and LCAG.
