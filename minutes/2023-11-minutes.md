# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2023-11-16 UTC 1600 

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Phil Reed, Toby Hodges, Annajiat Rasel

## Agenda

#### Proposal to revise title of Introduction to Working with Data (Regular Expressions) lesson

LC-CAC agree with [issue 22](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors/issues/22) that the Intro to Working with Data lesson title is misleading, and will consider renaming it to emphasize "pattern matching" in 2024 as part of larger plans to restructure core curriculum and add lesson pathways. 

#### Curriculum on-boarding update 
LC curriculum on-boarding slides have been revised and a session will be offered in Jan or Feb 2024. Phil, Cody, and Tim are all available to help present. 

*Action items*: Toby will schedule two community meetings (to account for time zones) and arrange to record the session for the Carpentries Youtube channel.

#### Intro to AI for GLAM
The alpha lesson was offered at the Fantastic Futures conference in Vancouver. The maintainers and instructors have [documented a number of ideas](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/machine-learning-librarians-archivists/issues/82) for improving the lesson. 

*Action items*:
Cody will reach out to maintainers to offer to support a code-sprint to help them make lesson updates and move it towards beta.

#### LC Intro to Python
Cody and Scott Peterson (Berkeley) are working on a [major revision in Cody's repo](https://github.com/chennesy/lc-python-intro), and will invite interested maintainers and contributors to [future meetings](https://pad.carpentries.org/lc-python-maintainers). Cody will share the revised lesson with CAC for review before updating the official repo. Tim and Cody proposed a pre-conference workshop using the new Python lesson for IASSIST 2024, and may also arrange an online alpha version workshop for further testing.

#### Lesson maintenance updates
- Phil has contacted MarcEdit maintainers and the lesson is filed under Extended now, instead of Conceptual. 
- Phil reached out following an inquiry on the CAC topicbox about possibilities for updating the FAIR Data lesson.
- Toby updated the Git lesson with instructions for configuring multi-factor authentication for GitHub Accounts. [See PR](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-git/pull/152/files). 
- Tim and Lisa McAulay continue the work to deprecate the LC Overview lesson.

*Action items*:

- Phil will follow up with LC maintainers to make sure the LC website lists the correct maintainer names for each lesson and to offer general CAC support.
- Tim will add the Intro to Computational Thinking lesson to the Incubator and put a note in index.md acknowledging Belinda's role as originating author.

#### 2024 meetings
Cody set up 2024 meetings following a new schedule with alternating meeting times (UTC 15:00 and UTC 23:00). Carpentries will recruit new members around April 2024. Current members are welcome to stay or role off as needed. 

*Action items*: Tim will reach out to Mary F to confirm her interest in joining CAC.

#### UCLA-IMLS Open Science Lessons
First year lessons are being developed and available at https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/. They will move into the Incubator when they're complete in 2024. A second call for participants will go out soon, and will be shared via Carpentries channels.

#### Items for future meetings
- CAC will reach out to maintainers in 2024 to invite them to attend CAC meetings and/or offer more code sprints to engage with broader LC communities. 
- A Carpentries Connect event will be held in Germany in Nov 2024. CAC might arrange to offer a session here. 
- CAC focus in 2024 will be to restructure the LC core curriculum and offer clear lesson pathways.
