# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2025-06-04 UTC 01:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy
## Agenda

### Open Science lesson pilots
Discussed how to promote the UCLA Open Science lessons in Library Carpentry so that more pilots are taught, and how to support those maintainers. 

#### Action items: 
- Tim will reach out to maintainers of the five most developed lessons to have a meeting with Tim and Cody and discuss strategies.
- Cody will review five other lessons to see if we should invite their maintainers to a possible second meeting (based on their relevance to LC audiences).

### LC-CAC & LC Governance recruitment
Discussed ideas for recruiting more volunteers to serve on the combined CAC/Governance group.

#### Action items: 
- Tim will run R script to pull list of most active contributors of LC lessons to reach out to.
- Cody will email Toby for contacts of LC maintainers for outreach.
