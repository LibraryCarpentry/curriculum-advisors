# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2023-03-16 UTC 16:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Phil Reed, Toby Hodges, Annajiat Alim Rasel

### Agenda

#### Updates

1. [A message template](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors/blob/main/notes/message-to-maintainers-2023-draft.md) offering LC-CAC assistance to LC maintainers is ready to go. CAC will wait for updated maintainer list from Erin/Toby after a recent email went out to all maintainers asking for their current commitment.
2. Cody and Toby met and are drafting slides for an LC instructor onboarding session using the Carpentries template. Many CAC members offered to help offer feedback and/or co-present. Aiming to present (and record) the onboarding online in June 2023.
3. Discussion about the [Workshop overview](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-overview/) lesson in LC, and opportunities to make lesson paths clearer to learners. 

*Action items*:
Cody will reach out to the LC Workshop overview maintainers to invite them to a future LC-CAC meeting (or alternate meeting) to discuss possible changes.

#### Alternate Git lesson with GUI focus
Discussion about [Nathaniel Porter's fork of the LC Git lesson](https://github.com/ndporter/lc-git-gui) which adds episodes on GitHub Desktop. Depending on learner feedback these changes might be worth merging with the primary LC git lesson. 

*Action items*:
Phil will reach out to Nathaniel to see if we can help connect the lesson with instructors to gather feedback. 

#### Starting point for OpenRefine lesson in Instructor check-outs

[Liz Stokes shared a need](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors/issues/14) for more potential starting points for instructors who want to demo the OpenRefine lesson in their check-out process. 

*Action items*:
Tim will look into this and propose potential starting points, being careful to look out for dependencies.


#### Adopting new lessons
1. [Intro to AI for GLAM](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-librarians-archivists/) is now available as Extended Curriculum on [LC lessons page](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/). UCLA will be teaching this in May. Still need to review lesson, flag issues, and evaluate with goal of moving from Incubator to LC Repo.
2. Discussed the possibility of porting Belinda Weaver's [Introducing Computational Thinking](https://weaverbel.github.io/intro-computational-thinking/) lesson to the Carpentries workbench.
3. Data Curation for Reproducibility: LC-CAC hasn't heard back from maintainers after reaching out to invite to future meeting. 

*Action items*:
Tim will reach out to arrange a meeting to discuss the Intro to Computational Thinking lesson with Belinda Weaver.
