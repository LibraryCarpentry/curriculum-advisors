# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2024-05-16 UTC 23:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Eka Grguric, Cody Hennesy, and Annajiat Alim Rasel.
 
## Agenda

#### Blog template for announcing new lessons
Tim shared a Google doc template for writing blog posts for Carpentries.org. CAC will use the template to create blog posts to promote new LC lessons.

*Action items*:  

- Tim will submit a PR to announce the new DMP101 lesson.
- Cody will write a post and submit a PR about the new Python lesson.


#### LC Overview update
The LC Overview lesson was moved under "Retired Curriculum" and the Tidy Data lesson was moved under  "Core Curriculum" on the LC lessons site. PRs were submitted to add Jargon Busting to the Tidy Data and Computational Thinking lessons. 

*Action items*:

- Tim will archive the LC Overview repository. 
- Cody will capture the Overview lesson content as a PDF and add it to Zenodo.
- Cody will draft a blog post to note the recent changes.
- Eka will ask her team if anyone is interested in being a maintainer for the Intro to Computational Thinking. 

#### CAC and LC Governance merger
These two groups plan to merge, and follow the 2024 schedule for CAC meetings. Given challenges in scheduling meetings across international time zones, we will develop more opportunities for asynchronous contributions. Current active members of both groups include Tim Dennis, Yared Abera Ergu, Eka Grguric, Cody Hennesy, and Annajiat Alim Rasel. 

*Action items:*

- Eka will confer with governance group to make sure this is agreeable to all. 
- Cody will reach out to Toby and ask about next steps.
- Tim will pull a list of active LC GitHub contributors to reach out to invite to join the merged CAC/Governance group.

#### LC Pathways proposal
CAC discussed an early draft of a potential way to organize the expanding collection of LC lessons into workshop pathways. Discussion noted that the topic paths should align with learning outcomes and competencies used by professional organizations and I Schools. CAC discussed possibilities for sharing pathways via lessons webpage or instructor pages. 

*Action items*:

- Tim and Eka will look up a few example I school learning objectives for next meeting.
- Cody will invite Toby to attend next meeting to discuss pathways in more depth.

#### LC Lesson page discussion
Much of the content on the lesson page is out of date or unnecessary (for example, there is no need to restate the lesson development process there - we could simply link to it). 

*Action items*: 

- Cody will set up a card sort for content on the lessons page, including pathway content, to share with LC-CAC. 
- Depending on feedback from the card sort, Cody will mock up a draft lessons page integrating initial pathway options. 

#### Items for future meetings

- Meetings with other Open Science lesson authors.
- LC pathways/menus
