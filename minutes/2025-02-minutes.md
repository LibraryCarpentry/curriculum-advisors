Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Annajiat Alim Rasel,
 
## Agenda

### Updates 
- December 2024 meeting was cancelled.
- Tim and Cody are working with Toby on planning a possible two-day curriculum development drive for research data management lessons in LC. Still looking to secure a location and date. There will be opportunities for participants in the United States to take part in person. Funding will be limited to folks in the US due to source of funding.
- We discussed different models for digital scholarship labs in libraries that Annajiat might be able to leverage for a grant proposal that is in progress.
- Four Curating for Reproducibility lessons are now on the workbench:

    - https://github.com/ucla-data-science-center/lc-cure-03
    - https://github.com/ucla-data-science-center/lc-cure-04

### Wikidata lesson
This topic was tabled for a later meeting since the maintainer was unable to attend.

### Action items: 
- Tim will fix the blog entry for the MarcEdit lesson (it was lost in the shuffle when Carpentries updated the websites). Update: [PR for the blog is here](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/librarycarpentry.org/pull/58).
- Tim will have a student at UCLA convert the [LC FAIR Research lesson](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-fair-research/) to the workbench in anticipation of the RDM workshop planning. 
- Cody will follow up with Rabea to reschedule a discussion of the Wikidata lesson. *Update: now scheduled for August 5 meeting*.
- Tim will reach out to Nathaniel to schedule a discussion of the [Open Qualitative Research lesson](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/open-qualitative-research/)

### Future meeting topics
- Invite Ariel and Sam to discuss [Open Science Team Agreements lesson](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/TeamAgreements/).
