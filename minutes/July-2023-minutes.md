# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2023-07-20 UTC 16:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy, Mark Laufersweiler, Phil Reed, Toby Hodges; Guests: Elizabeth (Lisa) McAulay, Thu-Mai Lewis Christian, Limor Peer, and Florio Arguillas

### Agenda

#### Introduction to Data Curation for Reproducibility

We discussed moving CURE's [Introduction to Data Curation for Reproducibility content](https://curating4reproducibility.org/training/) into Library Carpentry as an alpha lesson. Guests Thu-Mai, Limor, and Florio provided background on the curriculum, and LC-CAC outlined steps to get the lessons into shape for the transition. Limor and some staff with the Odum Institute are likely interested in staying on as lesson maintainers, and we discussed finding another maintainer or two who are familiar with the Carpentries GitHub workflows.

*Action items*:

- Thu-Mai's team will update the lesson and work through the lesson checklist. 
- Thu-Mai's team will also initiate the migration to the new workbench, making sure to merge any existing PRs before making the transition.
- Once the lesson is ready Tim will move the alpha lesson into LC; the CURE team could write a blog post to help get the lessons out to instructors for piloting; and LC-CAC will review the curriculum to integrate and link to related lessons (e.g., FAIR data) as needed.


#### LC Onboarding Slidedeck
LC-CAC reviewed the process for onboarding instructors to LC, including a [draft slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GCqeFDGeiMn3oDTsTOgdspRXqtnKt-WtXyeH_u0pIV8/edit). The plan is to share the slides during a community call that will be recorded for the YouTube Carpentries channel. The target audience is instructors who are interested in teaching LC.

*Action items*:
Toby sent an email to volunteers Liz Stokes, Lisa McAuley, and Tim to review the slidedeck, asking for feedback by August 14, 2023. Once the slides are updated LC-CAC will schedule a community call to present and record the onboarding.

#### LC Git and LC Workshop Overview lessons (Lisa)

We discussed opportunities and priorities for updating these two lessons. 

*Action items*:

- Lisa, Toby, Cody, and Mark scheduled a follow up meeting to outline changes to the LC Workshop Overview lesson on August 17. 
- Changes to LC Git are being tabled until after updating the Workshop Overview lesson. 

#### Intro to AI for GLAM 
We plan to discuss any unresolved [checklist issues from this lesson](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/machine-learning-librarians-archivists) at a future meeting.


#### UCLA-IMLS Open Science Lessons & upcoming lesson development workshop
Tim gave a brief update and can cover at greater length at the next meeting. Seven open science proposals were awarded grants to develop new lessons on topics such as CARE, OS team agreements, OS hardware, and more.

#### LC Intro to Python
A small subgroup stayed to discuss major updates to the Intro to Python lesson which hasn't been actively maintained and could use dataset and content updates. We plan to change the IDE from Spyder to Jupyter and adapt the episodes to use the DOAJ dataset from the OpenRefine lesson.

*Action items*:

- Cody contacted former lesson maintainers [on GitHub](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-python-intro/issues/108) to outline the plan and invite input/participation. 
- Cody will fork the lesson and draft initial changes while seeking co-maintainers. In the meantime a banner/warning will be added to the LC lesson to note that major updates are in the works and will be updated by a chosen date. 
- Phil will reach out to a team at Edinburgh who regularly teach the current lesson to let them know changes are on the way.

#### Items to review at future meeting
- Past action item: Phil will make change on website for MarcEdit to move to conceptual lesson and contact maintainers
- UCLA-IMLS Open Science Lessons update
- Intro to AI for GLAM lesson checklist
