# Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee 
### Meeting minutes: 2023-01-12 UTC 16:00:00

Attending: Tim Dennis (chair), Cody Hennesy (notes), Phil Reed, Toby Hodges, Annajiat Alim Rasel


### Agenda

#### LC Lesson Adoption Policy

The group discussed the proposed [lesson adoption process](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors/blob/main/policy/lesson-adoption.md) for LC, which has been updated by Toby to reflect organizational practices. All present voted to approve the policy, but agreed to move the vote to a GitHub issue to ensure that absent members would have a chance to weigh in.

*Action items*:
LC-CAC will vote on whether or not to approve the lesson adoption process with thumbs-up/down emojis on a GitHub issue that Cody will create.

#### Retiring Web Scraping Lesson
LC-CAC reached out to the maintainers of the [LC Web scraping lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-webscraping/) to check in on its status since it has a number of major and longstanding issues. The maintainers agreed it would be best to retire the current lesson. LC-CAC discussed the need (and ideas) for a new Web Scraping lesson.

*Action items:*
Cody will look into next steps for assembling a team to build a new Python web scraping lesson with more modular tools (possibly requests, BeautifulSoup, and/or Selenium) this Spring. First step will be to consult the [Collaborative Lesson Development Training Workshop](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/); if a new lesson is developed, it will follow the new Carpentries Workbench.
 

#### UCLA's IMLS Open Science for Librarians

Tim asked members to share the call for proposals for the IMLS-funded [Open Science for Librarians](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/). The lessons created will follow Carpentries templates and are likely candidates for future inclusion in LC curricula. Calls are open until Jan 31, 2023. Applicants from outside of the US are welcome.

#### New LC Lesson updates
Tim reached out to the lead author of the Introduction to Data Curation for Reproducibility workshop inviting them to a future LC-CAC to discuss possible inclusion in LC. The Intro to AI for GLAM maintainers have a few more items to address before moving out of the incubator. Tim will connect the AI for GLAM maintainers with Toby for next steps once the lesson is ready.

#### Lesson Audit update
Existing LC lessons were reviewed and sorted into categories so that LC-CAC can reach out to the maintainers offering different levels of support. Possible support includes arranging for code sprints or bug BBQs to address outstanding issues, checking in with maintainers on whether or not they'd like to continue as a maintainer, and offering support for Conceptual and Alpha lesson maintainers to move into Beta (or back to the Incubator). 

*Action items:*
Phil will follow up to plan next steps.

#### LC lesson retirement
* Toby transferred the LC XML lesson to the Incubator with a README in the repo noting that it is no longer maintained. 
* The Top Ten FAIR Data & Software Things lesson is more complex since it doesn't use the Carpentries lesson template. 
* The Web Scraping lesson will be retired.

*Action items*:

* Phil will create a new "Retired lessons" heading for the LC Lessons page and move the XML, Top Ten FAIR, and Web Scraping lessons there (and out of the other lesson categories).  
* Toby will move the Web Scraping lesson into the Incubator with a note in the README to flag that it is not currently maintained. 
* Toby will make the Top Ten FAIR repository read-only.

#### Tabled for later meetings
