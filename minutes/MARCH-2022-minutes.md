### Meeting minutes: Mon 14 Mar 2022 UTC 8:00pm
Attending: Annajiat Alim Rasel, Cody Hennesy (Secretary), Liz Stokes (Chair), Phil Reed, Tim Dennis, Toby Hodges

### Agenda

#### Purpose of committee
* Reviewed the Carpentries [CAC consultation rubric](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/cac-consult-rubric.html).
* Primary purpose is to prioritize new lessons for development, reinvigorate development and maintenance of the existing LC core curriculum.

#### Issues and pull requests tagged to CAC on Github
* Reviewed existing GitHub "refer to cac" tags on LC curriculum. 
* CAC plans to contact maintainers to let them know to tag @LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors for any issue/pull request discussions they want to bring to our attention.
* CAC will create criteria for auditing lessons that aren't active and contact maintainers of those lessons to discuss moving them to incubator or retiring.
* Discussed possible incubator lessons that are of potential interest to add to LC curriculum. Tabled this discussion (and criteria related for adding lessons to LC) for future meeting.

#### Grant involvement
* Discussed committee member engagement with a proposal for an IMLS grant related to Open Science curriculum for librarians that might engage with Library Carpentry in the future (if funded). Committee approved involvement.

#### Housekeeping
* Discussed arranging a Birds of Feather session at CarpentryCon for CACs to discuss best practices across Carpentries.
* Clarified scheduling preferences for future meetings: one meeting with staggered times to accomodate time zone differences; next three meetings will be scheduled for days before/after existing LC Advisory Group meetings for 2022.
* Tim volunteered to serve as Chair of LC-CAC in interim role until the next Carpentries-led CAC onboarding (Summer 2022). 

### Action items
 
* Liz will email Erin and Toby to confirm Tim as interim chair.
* Toby will share slides on CAC onboarding with Tim.
* Cody will contact LC lesson maintainers to make sure to tag @LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors for any issue/pull request discussions they want to bring to our attention.
* Phil will draft initial criteria and a workflow for identifying LC lessons that could possibly be moved to the Incubator or be retired.
* Phil will follow up with LC maintainers for lessons that meet the above criteria to discuss possibilities for moving/retiring lessons.
