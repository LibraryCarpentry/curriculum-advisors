This document describes the process for proposing and adopting Library Carpentries lessons into the curriculum. We will adopt the [Carpentries Lab](https://carpentries-lab.org/) as the primary way for adding new Library Carpentry lessons to the curriculum. There can be exceptions to accepting lessons outside of this process at the discretion of the CAC. 

### Assumed Prior Work

* Lesson authors will have designed their lesson with the [Library Carpentry audiences](https://librarycarpentry.org/audience/) in focus, e.g. library and information-related communities. 
* Lesson authors will follow the Carpentries-style lesson development process as outlined in the Curriculum Development Handbook (see the [Collaborative Lesson Development Training lesson for guidance](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/)). 
* Lesson authors will use the Carpentries Workbench and lesson template. 

## Process for Lesson Adoption 

1. LC-CAC will assess whether or not a particular lesson makes sense for a Library Carpentry audience. This can arise from lesson authors reaching out to LC-CAC or the CAC identifying lessons of interest from the Incubator or other Carpentries repos.
2. When an alpha lesson is deemed a good fit for an LC audience, the CAC will reach out to maintainers to invite them to discuss potential inclusion in the LC curriculum. If the maintainers are interested, they can meet with the CAC to review the lesson. CAC will advise them on any changes necessary to help the lesson move from alpha to beta. 
3. Once the maintainers have met the criteria to move a lesson from alpha to beta, the CAC will add the lesson to the LC website "Extended Curriculum" section and reach out to LC channels to find instructors who would like to teach the lesson and provide feedback to the maintainers.
4. Once the lesson has been taught and maintainers have responded to feedback, the maintainers will request a review in [Carpentries Labs](https://carpentries-lab.org/). 
5. Members of LC-CAC will serve an editorial role in the Labs process, going through the initial Labs checklist and helping to find suitable peer reviewers for the lesson.
