This document describes the process for proposing and adopting Library Carpentries lessons into the curriculum. We will adopt the Carpentries Lab as the primary way for adding new Library Carpentry lessons to the curriculum. There can be exceptions to accepting lessons outside of this process at the discretion of the CAC. 

### Assumed Prior Work

* Lesson authors will have designed their lesson with the [Library Carpentry audiences](https://librarycarpentry.org/audience/) in focus, e.g. library and information-related communities. 
* Lesson authors will follow the Carpentries-style lesson development process as outlined in the Curriculum Development Handbook (see the [Collaborative Lesson Development Training lesson for guidance](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/)). 
* Lesson authors will use the Carpentries Workbench and lesson template. 

## Process for Lesson Adoption 

1. Lesson authors submit to the Carpentries Lab and follow steps outlined.
2. Lesson authors work with the CAC
